## What to hand in

Students should produce a very short report/executive summary that quickly outlines what they did and their results with a comparison of their results to conclusions of Mosteller and Wallace. The short report/executive summary should be submitted through canvas. As always it should be well formatted and organized. Your report should include a link to the associated github (see code at bottom of this document). All code should be well documented and in the associated github so we can review/replicate your analytic work.
